        <p style="font-size: 15px;">
            The founders of this company are Balveen Kaur, Danyce Lee, Low Xuan Jie, Lim Ru Mei and Micah Angela. 
            They are thinking of an idea for a project on E-Business that provides the customer with convience 
            when purchasing it online. While discussing, they realised that in this century people are alwasys on 
            social media platform posting pictures and stories. They realised a trend where people loves to 
            celebrate parties in a very grand manner in order to post it on sical media. The fellow teammates see 
            this as a good opportunity to go for. Therefore, they started small by being their own manpower, 
            once in a while relatives and friend came to help out, storing those products at home and slowly 
            progressing to a more successful and recognised company
